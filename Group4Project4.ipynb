It was also difficult to split work in some ways, because how interdependent all of the pieces of code end up being. \n",

I also learned how to coordinate a project better with github, which was useful and different from just pulling from the class repository. \n",

I'd also like to implement better exception handling. From a methods perspective, I think it would be interesting to try other methods of clustering the data and see what would be different. I'd also like to ask what features of the expression data were especially useful in separating out the two cancer clusters, and what about the misclassified samples is leading them to be misclassified. \n"

    "The hardest part for me was learning to use a new toolkit in the form of sklearn.  The documentation was good, but since Pandas was my weakest portion of the course, it was hard to properly understand and run functions from the package.  Additionally, I personally struggled with having the foresight to see what the order in which things needed to be done would be.  Which made it difficult to assign responsibilities early on and get the project underway.\n",

The first helped me shore up my knowledge with dataframes as I was able to continue to work with them myself, as well as see what my code my teammates wrote to deal with the challenges of this project.  The second was that this helped me use matplotlib.pyplot more which helped me think about how data is plotted after being generated, and the amount of complexities that are possible using this package.\n",

The scikitlearn package contains other clustering methods such as affinity propogation and agglomerative clustering.  It would be interesting to be able to comparere the differences between the output of these algorithms as even if they have the same approximate \"average\" accuracy, they may differ in other statistics such as F1 score, or precision. \n"
